Program 01

What it does:
This program uses a selection of 2 different sorting algorithms (bubble sort and insertion sort)
to sort a large text file. When the file is sorted, it displays the time it took for it to be sorted.

How I did it:
For the bubble sort, writing down the passes and the iterations helped a bit for the understanding
of how it works. I also took some time looking at the slides for assistance. Looking at the slides
helped a lot for the insertion sort. It took me a second to realize what it was actually doing in
the little display example in the slides. Once I understood both sorting algorithms, they were
pretty easy to code.
